## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### For the Web Application (Keeper Tool & ADP Viewer)

1.  **Set up Backend Environment:**
    
    - **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
      ```bash
      # Create virtual environment
      python -m venv venv
      
      # Activate it (Windows)
      source venv/Scripts/activate
      
      # Activate it (macOS/Linux)
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```
    
    - **Install Python dependencies:**
      ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```
    
    - **Create a `.env` file** in the root directory with your Sleeper username:
      ```
      SLEEPER_USERNAME=your_username_here
      ```

2.  **Set up Frontend Environment:**
    - Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
      ```bash
      cd frontend
      ```
    - Install Node.js dependencies:
      ```bash
      npm install
      ```
    - Go back to the root directory:
      ```bash
      cd ..
      ```

3.  **Run the Application:**
    - **Start the Backend API:** Open a terminal in the root directory and run:
      ```bash
      python api.py
      ```
    - **Start the Frontend App:** Open a *second* terminal, navigate to `frontend`, and run:
      ```bash
      npm run dev
      ```
    - Open your browser to the local URL provided (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

### For the Command-Line ADP Calculator

1.  **Import mock drafts:**
    ```bash
    python3 import_mock_drafts.py
    ```
